## Continuous assessment

Note the following split:
- 15% continuous assessment (short exercises and Q&As given during exercise classes, Grading: Best 3/6 normalized)
- 20% homework (Grading: Best 2/3)
- 30% project (writeup and presentation (for bonus))
- 35% written exam

Preliminary dates for continuous assessments (CA): 
- 21/10/2024 (Monday): CA on Approximation and complexity theory
- 24/10/2024 (Thursday): QA on Optimization
- 14/11/2024 (Thursday): CA on Loss landscape in Neural networks
- 18/11/2024 (Monday): QA on Neural tangent kernel
- 02/12/2024 (Monday): CA on Generalization bounds I + II
- 19/12/2024 (Thursday): QA on Reguarlization and Architectures

**A 50% score on HW sets is required to participate in the final exam. A score of 3 out of 6 is required at the exam to pass the class.**

## Exam
Date for written exam: Thursday, February 6, 2025, 10-12 a.m., Spiegelgasse 5, room 05.002.

Information about the exam: you can bring two two-sided A4 sheets or four one-sided A4 sheets (hand-written or latex).

## Homework
You have to hand in two homework sheets out of the following three options:

1) [Basics, Approximation and Complexity theory](homework_2024/DL2024_HW1.pdf) (Period: 19/09/2024 18:00 - 24/10/2024 23:55)
2) [Optimization, Loss landscape and Neural tangent kernel](homework_2024/DL2024_HW2.pdf)  (Period: 17/10/2024 18:00 - 21/11/2024 23:55)
3) [Generalization, Regularization and Adversarial examples](homework_2024/DL2024_HW3.pdf)  (Period: 14/11/2024 18:00 - 26/12/2024 23:55)

Each homework is required to be written in Latex using the provided template [hw_template.zip](homework_2024/hw_template.zip). Each homework has to be submitted in "Homework" section via ADAM.
The submitted file name should be in form "[full name]_hw[n]" where n is the index of the exercise.  
Each homework is equally weighted. 
Any homework that is sent late will not be graded and will be worth no credit. 

## Projects
Projects have to be completed within a group of 2-3 students. Two types of projects you can pursue are:
1) A novel and sound solution to a problem discussed in the class
2) Thorough theoretical analysis of an existing deep learning approach discussed in the class
Students cannot use their own published work as the course project.
Deadline: 05/02/2025 12:00 Bern time
Submission: on ADAM
